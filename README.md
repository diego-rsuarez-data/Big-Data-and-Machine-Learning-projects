# Big Data and Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains my professional projects in **Machine Learning, Statistical Modeling, Big Data processing, and Predictive Analytics**, developed in Python and R.  
Projects explore various methods, from basic algorithms to advanced ensemble models, including hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and probability calibration.  

## Skills & Techniques Highlighted
- **Machine Learning:** Supervised and unsupervised methods, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
- **Statistical Modeling:** PCA, Fisher Discriminant, regression, hypothesis testing
- **Predictive Modeling & Anomaly Detection**
- **Big Data Tools:** Apache Spark
- **Programming & Data Science Tools:** Python, R, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **APIs & Data Pipelines**
- **Model Interpretability:** SHAP and feature importance

## Projects

Each project is **self-contained** with its own:
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks with clean code and results
- `data/` – Original datasets (no sensitive data)
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies
- `README.md` – Project-specific description and methodology

**Note:** All projects are **public** for viewing, but only I can edit them.
